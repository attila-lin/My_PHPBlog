#kNN---教务网验证码

还要简单介绍下kNN么？
就是说要test的东西，在k范围内，和哪一类最像，那他就算哪一类。

> Example of k-NN classification. The test sample (green circle) should be classified either to the first class of blue squares or to the second class of red triangles. If k = 3 (solid line circle) it is assigned to the second class because there are 2 triangles and only 1 square inside the inner circle. If k = 5 (dashed line circle) it is assigned to the first class (3 squares vs. 2 triangles inside the outer circle).               --来自wiki
